  |   While playing in the park, Zee follows a squirrel through a portal    |
  |   to a world of echoes, inhabited by a shadow child. Surrounded by      |
  |   the unknown and trapped in a series of realms both confusing and      |
  |   dangerous, the youngsters must avoid slipping into the pool between   |
  |   dimensions, embarking on a voyage of discovery and awakening they     |
  |   share with the player, up and down staircases, through light and      |
  |   dark, across the upside-down and the right side-up to their           |
  |   eventual freedom.                                                     |

  |   Samsara is a puzzle game where players guide an innocent child        |
  |   named Zee safely to the exit, by dropping blocks with different       |
  |   shapes and properties into a world of two dimensions separated by a   |
  |   pool that mirrors placements. Deceptively simple mechanics conceal    |
  |   rich and complex interactions that involve positioning,               |
  |   pathfinding, gravity, balance, redirection and teleportation, with    |
  |   Samsara's significant twist: everything added in the upside down      |
  |   world of Zee's mysterious shadow below reflects in the world above.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Explore the reflected dimensions of 77 levels across 6                |
  |   hand-detailed realms, each with hidden "Easter Eggs" to uncover.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In this addictive game of echoes and contrasts, the children          |
  |   journey up and down staircases, through light and dark, across        |
  |   realms of the upside-down and the right-side-up to their eventual     |
  |   freedom...                                                            |

  |   * Explore the reflected dimensions of the original Samsara's 77       |
  |     levels across 6 hand-detailed realms                                |

  |   * Deluxe content: New first to Switch content with an additional 24   |

  |   * Simple play mechanic - choose, rotate and drop blocks and utilize   |
  |     their reflections                                                   |

  |   * Blocks must be both balanced and will respond to gravity, falling   |
  |     towards the pool between the two dimensions, allowing asymmetric    |
  |     placements...                                                       |

  |   * ...Although later in the game, new types of block reflections may   |
  |     behave "unusually" under gravity                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Environmental interaction includes falling stones, and thorns       |
  |     which grow on contact with Zee's echo but shrivel at Zee's own      |
  |     touch, allowing timed block movements to be set up                  |
